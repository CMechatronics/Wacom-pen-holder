Wacom pens from the CTL-4100 series and similar variants, also for pens with a diameter equal to or less than 12 mm.

Measurements referenced in the uploaded images. (It might be interesting in case you use different tips to consult these measurements in the blueprints I have uploaded).

How to proceed to 3D print:

These two pieces might be too hard to turn the screw.
If this is your case: screw in and unscrew to increase the play between the two pieces.

Due to manufacturing tolerances, it might not work in your case. If so, you could scale the part "Soporte wacom parte 2" up by a few millimeters.
